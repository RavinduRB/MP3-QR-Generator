One day I was curious if I could turn an MP3 song into a QR code. As far as I know, MP3 songs and MP4 videos cannot be converted to QR codes. But I was able to convert an MP3 song into a QR code ðŸš€. I used Python to create this.

When I tested my code I could see what happened. What has happened is that the file path related to the song has become a QR code.

If you want to try this then do as below.

After running the program, you first select a song through the Upload MP3 button. After selecting, a QR code will be generated for you. You can save it anywhere by clicking the Download QR Code(s) button. Then scan the QR code through another webcam connected to the computer. Then copy the received file path, open Google Chrome, paste it in the URL typing bar, and run it. Then the song you selected will play.
